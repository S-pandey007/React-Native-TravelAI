# AI Travel Itinerary Generator

The AI Travel Itinerary Generator is a mobile application built using React Native that helps users generate personalized travel itineraries using AI. Users input their travel details such as starting place, destination, duration, and budget, and the app provides a detailed day-wise itinerary, including popular places to visit, local food recommendations, and travel tips. The app utilizes Google Generative AI to generate the itineraries and provides a seamless navigation experience between input and detailed itinerary screens.

## Features

1. **User Input Form**:
   - Collects travel details from the user (name, starting place, destination, duration, and budget).
   - Validates user input to ensure all necessary information is provided.

2. **AI-Powered Itinerary Generation**:
   - Uses Google Generative AI to generate personalized itineraries based on user input.
   - Provides detailed day-wise plans, including places to visit, food recommendations, and travel tips.

3. **Loading Screen**:
   - Displays a loading animation with changing text messages while the itinerary is being generated.

4. **Detailed Itinerary View**:
   - Presents the generated itinerary in a user-friendly format.
   - Allows users to navigate back to the input form to generate new itineraries.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Framework for building native apps using React.
- **React Navigation**: Library for navigation in React Native apps.
- **React Hook Form**: Library for managing form state and validation.
- **Google Generative AI**: API used for generating travel itineraries.
- **React Native Vector Icons**: Library for using vector icons in React Native.

## File Descriptions

### `App.js`

The main entry point of the application. It sets up the navigation container and stack navigator for handling screen navigation.

- **Imports**: React Native and navigation components.
- **Navigation Container**: Wraps the stack navigator to manage navigation state.
- **Stack Navigator**: Defines the navigation stack with two screens: Home and Detail.

### `index.js`

The home screen where users input their travel details. It handles form state management, input validation, and submits the form to generate the itinerary.

- **Imports**: React, React Native components, Google Generative AI, React Hook Form, and navigation.
- **Form Handling**: Uses `react-hook-form` for managing form state and validation.
- **AI Integration**: Calls Google Generative AI to generate the itinerary based on user input.
- **Navigation**: Navigates to the Detail screen with the generated itinerary.

### `Detail.js`

Displays the detailed itinerary generated by the AI. Users can view day-wise plans and navigate back to the home screen.

- **Imports**: React, React Native components, navigation, and vector icons.
- **Itinerary Rendering**: Processes and formats the generated itinerary text for display.
- **Navigation**: Includes a back button to return to the home screen.

### `LoadingScreen.js`

A component that displays a loading animation and changing text messages while the itinerary is being generated.

- **Imports**: React, React Native components.
- **Loading Animation**: Shows an `ActivityIndicator` and cycling text messages to indicate loading progress.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - The user opens the app and lands on the Home screen.
   - The user fills out the input form with travel details.
   - Upon form submission, the app displays the Loading screen.

2. **AI Itinerary Generation**:
   - The app calls the Google Generative AI with the user-provided details.
   - The AI generates a detailed travel itinerary.

3. **Display Itinerary**:
   - The app navigates to the Detail screen with the generated itinerary.
   - The user can view the day-wise itinerary and navigate back to the Home screen to generate new itineraries.

## UI/UX Design

- **Home Screen**:
  - Simple and clean design with input fields for user details.
  - A submit button to generate the itinerary.

- **Loading Screen**:
  - Displays an activity indicator and cycling text messages to keep the user engaged while waiting.

- **Detail Screen**:
  - Organized layout to present the itinerary in a readable format.
  - A back button for easy navigation to the Home screen.
